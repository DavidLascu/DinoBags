# DinoBags

# Inspiration
I have been growing more and more curious about the concept of NFT's and what it takes to enter that space. I had a basic understanding of the concept but never had a chance to explore them in depth. I took this hackathon as an opportunity to create a set of NFT's and learn about the concept while doing it.

# What it does
DinoBags are a set of randomly generated NFT's using a collection of 16 pixel Dinos. These dinos have different rarities and probabilities to be printed. I had to modify an existing script to generate these images.

# How we built it
The images were generated using a JavaScript program and all the assets were individually taken from a copyright free source and edited in a photo editor. The NFT pieces are hosted on the Blockchain by Opensea.io.

# Challenges we ran into
I had never worked with anything remotely similar to there concepts so it was a lot of learning about the space and watching tutorials.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
I am proud to have so quickly picked up a concept I previously regarded as foreign.

# What's next for DinoBags
Now that it is hosted on Opensea it opens the possibility for potential collectors to invest in the project. I will try my best to market it in a way that could help it grow in the space.
